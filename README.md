NOIZ is your game live streaming platform — think Twitch or Mixer, but built from the ground up with your own legal, branding, and feature decisions.

From everything we’ve worked on together, here’s the distilled picture:

1. Core Purpose

NOIZ is designed to let creators stream live gameplay (and other content) while building an engaged audience.
It’s not just a video player — it’s a full creator ecosystem with quests, marketplace, virtual currency, and community tools.

2. Key Differences From Twitch/Mixer

Virtual Currency (Decibels) — Two types:

⚡︎dB (Charged Decibels): Earned via platform activity and eligible for cashout.

dB (Faded Decibels): Purchased, but must be spent within the platform before becoming ⚡︎dB.

Quest System — Instead of just watching, viewers engage in quests linked to games, brands, or campaigns for XP and rewards.

Level-Based Monetization — No application process for higher revenue splits; if you earn enough XP to hit the tier, you get the better split automatically.

Marketplace — Users list digital goods like avatar frames, profile effects, resonance stickers, etc., redeemable with Decibels.

No Ads — Monetization happens via support, not pre-rolls or mid-rolls.

Vibe System — Paid chat interactions and animations that trigger on-stream.

Reverb (Channel Points) — Earned by watching, redeemable for custom channel rewards.

Clip + VOD Support — Like Twitch, but integrated tightly into profile navigation.

3. Roles & Badges

You’ve built an extensive badge/role system:

Platform Roles: Affiliate, Partner, DCT (moderators), Staff, Pathweavers (infra contributors), Artists, Ambassadors, Sponsors.

Achievement Badges: Time-based, vibe badges, gift badges, quest progress markers.

Channel Roles: Mods, editors, special chat roles.

4. Viewer & Streamer Experience
Navigation

Discover: Featured live channels + horizontal slider of games to filter them.

Browse: All games as cards → click a game to see streamers playing it.

Quests: Cards for brands/games → click to see quest progress, rewards, campaign hero.

Market: Items listed with seller info, price in dB, type, and unlock option.

Channel Views

Offline: Chat + member list, rules, VODs, profile info.

Live: Video player, live chat with badges, quick access to channel profile, market, VODs, clips, rules.

5. Legal & Structural Choices

All support is framed as virtual goods transactions to avoid financial instrument issues.

“Wallet” is called Constellation, framed as a ledger, not a bank.

No gambling-style drops — all rewards are structured, not random.

Revenue language is “support,” “rewards,” “recognition,” not “payment” or “salary.”
